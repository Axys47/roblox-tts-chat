# roblox-tts-chat
basically just a simple serverscript that narrates a new message sent in chat for all players via the new text to speech api.

be advised that this api has a rate limit after a certain amount of requests: https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/AudioTextToSpeech

to set up just copy the contents of tts.server.luau and paste it in ServerScriptService.


or if you have rojo either download the file and put it in Server or create it yourself. :D
